The parameters detected are useful for a posteriori analysis, allowing to evaluate the patient's state during the setting, relaxation and interaction phase.  Other parameters such as liking, personal involvement, relaxation and interaction are evaluated by the health care professional/technician during the test run. At the end of the protocol a PDF report is produced to document the activity performed by that specific patient.</p>

          <p>The proposed methodology uses voice commands as an interface for the creation of a 3D model of conics. The results achieved obviously reinforce the strong link between descriptive geometry and algebra, since it is known that there is no construction of descriptive geometry that cannot be analytically translated, and vice versa. By combining the theories of Drawing, those of Analytical Geometry and artificial intelligence frameworks, a new modus agendi for the designer is presented.
